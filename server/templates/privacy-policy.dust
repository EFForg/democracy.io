    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
      <p>Democracy.io is a project of Taskforce.is and we take your privacy seriously. Among our fundemental principles:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact information unless specifically stated so.</li>
      <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we need it.</li>
      <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for a specific feature, such as delivering a message to congress, connecting you via phone to your representatives, or delivering a petition.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
      <p>Like many websites, Democracy.io collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Democracy.io’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Democracy.io’s visitors use its website.</p>
      <p>Democracy.io also uses potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purpose of geolocating users to show appropriate actions and content. For example, if you are based in the US, we will use your IP address to show you content about pending laws in the US Congress. However, Democracy.io does not store IP addresses, and would only disclose IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Certain visitors to Democracy.io's websites choose to interact with Democracy.io in ways that require Democracy.io to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Democracy.io gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to be part of the day of action to provide an email address so that we may contact them. Those who engage in actions with Democracy.io – by sending an email to Congress or calling their representatives, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those actions. In each case, Democracy.io collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Democracy.io. Democracy.io does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
      <h3>Third-party services</h3>
      <p>Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and may be shared with the following services:
      <ul>
      <li>Google Analytics (Alphabet, Inc) (<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">privacy policy</a>) - For analytics about visits to the site.</li>

      <li>Twitter, Inc. (<a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>) - For tweet buttons and sharing features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order the use particular features of the site, you may be required to share your personally-identifying information with these third-party service providers for the purpose of enabling the functionality of the site, and in some instances, for example sending a message or calling your representatives, we may give one or more of these service providers limited access to the personally-identifying information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the service.</p>
      <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
      <p>Democracy.io may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Democracy.io may monitor the number of users who've messaged each representative or who've visited a particular page on the website.

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Democracy.io may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to third party services, your representatives, contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on Democracy.io’s behalf or to provide services available at Democracy.io. Some of those contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Democracy.io’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.  For example, affiliated organizations may be asked to help deliver messages and petitions to Congress.</p>
      <p>Democracy.io will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Democracy.io discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Democracy.io believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Democracy.io, third parties or the public at large.</p>
      <p>If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>

We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
